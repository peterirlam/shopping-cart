# 💻 &nbsp; React.js/Express/Stripe Shopping Cart


# 📖 &nbsp; Overview

This app uses Express on the backend and features a fully functional shopping cart. Add or remove items and your basket will update. Click on your cart to see your totals displayed in a modal. When you're ready to purchase your items, you'll be redirected to the Stripe payment dashboard. This details your items including their descriptions. Don't worry you won't be charged!

## 🎱 &nbsp; Why I Chose This Project

Up till recently, my focus has been on the frontend. I'm now turning my attention to backend technologies such as Express.js, Java and GraphQL (although not strictly backend).

Furthermore, as shopping carts are such a useful and necessary function for most online companies, I wanted to evidence my ability to build a fully functional cart with payment processing system.

## ⏲️ &nbsp; If I Had More Time I Would Change

This repo is still a work in progress. I need to add:
- [x] A logo
- [x] A favicon
- [x] Some content to the Home and About page
- [x] More products to the store
- [x] Move images folder from public to src as images are optimized inside src

## 🏁 &nbsp; Finished product

✅ Fully functional shopping cart: add, remove and delete items
✅ Modal checkout when ready to purchase items
✅ Redirects user to Stripe
